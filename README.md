Enabling Assessment 1: HTML Personal Site

INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Create your own version of the "My Personal Site"
    2. Add additional structure/details on your personal site. (Ex: Media)
    3. Upload your webpage files in GitHub pages
    4. Submit the GitHub link of your uploaded webpage

I tried to push using VS Code + Git without reading any documentation and somehow it worked.
